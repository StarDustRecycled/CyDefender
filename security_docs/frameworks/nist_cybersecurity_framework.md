### 5. RESPOND (RS)
**Purpose:** Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.

**Categories:**  
- **RS.MA:** Management
- **RS.AN:** Analysis
- **RS.MI:** Mitigation
- **RS.RP:** Reporting
- **RS.CO:** Communications

**Response Activities:**
- Incident response planning
- Evidence collection and analysis
- Containment and eradication
- Internal and external communications
- Regulatory reporting requirements

### 6. RECOVER (RC)
**Purpose:** Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

**Categories:**
- **RC.RP:** Recovery Planning
- **RC.IM:** Improvements  
- **RC.CO:** Communications

**Recovery Elements:**
- Business continuity planning
- Disaster recovery procedures
- System restoration processes
- Lessons learned integration
- Stakeholder communications during recovery

## Implementation Tiers

### Tier 1: Partial
- Limited awareness of cybersecurity risk
- Ad hoc or reactive approach
- Risk management irregular
- Limited external participation

### Tier 2: Risk Informed  
- Aware of cybersecurity risk but no organization-wide approach
- Risk management practices approved by management but not established as policy
- Limited external participation

### Tier 3: Repeatable
- Organization-wide approach to cybersecurity risk
- Risk management practices formally approved and expressed as policy
- Regular external participation and collaboration

### Tier 4: Adaptive
- Organization adapts cybersecurity practices based on lessons learned and predictive indicators
- Risk management integrated into organizational culture and business functions
- Advanced external participation and collaboration

## Profiles

### Current Profile
- Documents current cybersecurity posture
- Identifies which Framework outcomes are currently achieved
- Based on business/mission requirements, risk tolerance, and resources

### Target Profile  
- Documents desired cybersecurity outcomes
- Built from Current Profile gaps and business drivers
- Prioritizes opportunities for improving cybersecurity posture

### Implementation Profile
- Roadmap for achieving Target Profile
- Prioritizes gaps based on business drivers, costs, and risks
- Defines milestones and success metrics
