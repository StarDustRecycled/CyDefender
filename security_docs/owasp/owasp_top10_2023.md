# OWASP Top 10 2023 - Web Application Security Risks

## Overview
The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

## Top 10 Web Application Security Risks (2023)

### A01:2023 – Broken Access Control
**Risk Level:** Critical
**Description:** Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Violation of the principle of least privilege
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying URL, internal application state, or HTML page
- Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account
- Acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in as a user

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use throughout the application
- Model access controls to enforce record ownership rather than accepting user-provided data
- Unique application business logic limits should be enforced by domain models
- Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata is not present within web roots

### A02:2023 – Cryptographic Failures
**Risk Level:** High
**Description:** Failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof), which often lead to exposure of sensitive data.

**Common Issues:**
- Transmitting data in clear text (HTTP, SMTP, FTP)
- Using old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols
- Using default crypto keys or weak/reused crypto keys
- Not enforcing encryption (missing security headers)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Classify data processed, stored, or transmitted by an application
- Apply controls per classification
- Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily; discard it ASAP or use PCI DSS compliant tokenization
- Ensure strong standard algorithms, protocols, and keys are in place; use proper key management

### A03:2023 – Injection
**Risk Level:** High  
**Description:** User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.

**Types of Injection:**
- SQL Injection
- NoSQL Injection
- OS Command Injection
- LDAP Injection
- Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection

**Prevention:**
- Use safe APIs which avoid interpreter entirely or provide parameterized interface
- Use positive server-side input validation
- Escape special characters using specific escape syntax for target interpreter
- Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records

### A04:2023 – Insecure Design
**Risk Level:** High
**Description:** Risks related to design and architectural flaws, calling for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns, and reference architectures.

**Key Concepts:**
- Secure design is a culture and methodology that constantly evaluates threats
- Secure coding is not the same as secure design
- Design flaws cannot be fixed by perfect implementation

**Prevention:**
- Establish and use a secure development lifecycle with AppSec professionals
- Establish and use a library of secure design patterns or paved road ready to use components
- Use threat modeling for critical authentication, access control, business logic, and key flows
- Integrate security language and controls into user stories

### A05:2023 – Security Misconfiguration
**Risk Level:** High
**Description:** Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack or improperly configured permissions on cloud services.

**Common Misconfigurations:**
- Unpatched flaws
- Default accounts and passwords still enabled and unchanged
- Error handling reveals stack traces or overly informative error messages
- Latest security features are disabled or not configured securely

**Prevention:**
- Repeatable hardening process makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is properly locked down
- Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment
- Minimal platform without unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples
- Review and update configurations appropriate to all security notes, updates, and patches

### A06:2023 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
**Risk Level:** High
**Description:** Components run with the same privileges as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact.

**Risk Factors:**
- Not knowing versions of all components used (both client-side and server-side)
- Software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date
- Not scanning for vulnerabilities regularly
- Not fixing or upgrading underlying platform, frameworks, and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion

**Prevention:**
- Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation
- Continuously inventory versions of both client-side and server-side components and their dependencies
- Monitor sources like Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for vulnerabilities
- Obtain components only from official sources over secure links

### A07:2023 – Identification and Authentication Failures
**Risk Level:** High
**Description:** Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management is critical to protect against authentication-related attacks.

**Common Issues:**
- Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing
- Permits default, weak, or well-known passwords
- Uses weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password processes
- Uses plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords

**Prevention:**
- Implement multi-factor authentication to prevent automated credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen credential re-use attacks
- Do not ship or deploy with default credentials, particularly for admin users
- Implement weak password checks, such as testing new or changed passwords against top 10,000 worst passwords list
- Ensure registration, credential recovery, and API pathways are hardened against account enumeration attacks

### A08:2023 – Software and Data Integrity Failures
**Risk Level:** High
**Description:** Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations.

**Examples:**
- Auto-update functionality where updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification
- Insecure deserialization where untrusted data is deserialized
- CI/CD pipelines have inadequate access controls

**Prevention:**
- Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify software or data is from expected source and has not been altered
- Ensure libraries and dependencies are consuming trusted repositories
- Use software supply chain security tool to verify components do not contain known vulnerabilities
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline has proper segregation, configuration, and access control

### A09:2023 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Description:** Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response.

**Common Failures:**
- Auditable events not logged
- Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log messages
- Logs not monitored for suspicious activity
- Logs only stored locally

**Prevention:**
- Ensure all login, access control, and server-side input validation failures can be logged with sufficient user context
- Ensure logs are generated in a format that log management solutions can easily consume
- Ensure log data is encoded correctly to prevent injections or attacks on logging or monitoring systems
- Ensure high-value transactions have audit trail with integrity controls

### A10:2023 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Description:** SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.

**Attack Scenarios:**
- Port scan internal servers
- Sensitive data exposure through file:/// URIs
- Access metadata storage of cloud services
- Compromise internal services

**Prevention:**
- Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data
- Enforce URL schema, port, and destination with a positive allow list
- Do not send raw responses to clients
- Disable HTTP redirections
- Be aware of URL consistency to avoid attacks such as DNS rebinding and TOCTOU race conditions
