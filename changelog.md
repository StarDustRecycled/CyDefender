# CyDefender Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Session Started] - 2025-07-21

### Added
- Created CHANGELOG.md to track all modifications made during development sessions

### Added
- Implemented SecurityReportManager class with comprehensive reporting capabilities
- Created reports/report_manager.py with vulnerability tracking, defense action logging, and timeline management
- Added HTML and JSON report generation with professional styling
- Integrated dataclasses for structured data handling (Vulnerability, DefenseAction, SecurityEvent)
- Integrated report collection into hack_agent.py and defense_agent.py
- Modified security_analysis_tools.py and defense_tools.py to automatically collect vulnerability and defense data
- Created generate_report.py standalone script for manual report generation
- Added automatic report generation at completion of agent runs
- Fixed vulnerability list handling in security analysis tools to prevent report generation errors
- Modified hack_agent to only collect data, not generate reports (reports generated by defense_agent for complete workflow)
- Updated defense_agent to always generate final reports regardless of data availability (Option A design)
- Fixed defense_tools.py to handle dict/list data types in recommendations and targets to prevent report generation errors
- Added session persistence to report_manager to maintain data between hack_agent and defense_agent runs
- Added automatic session reset after defense_agent completes report generation
- Fixed endpoint tracking in vulnerability reports to show actual endpoints tested instead of 'Unknown'
- Changed report language from "Defenses Implemented" to "Defense Actions Recommended" for accuracy
- Modified analyze_security_response to accept endpoint parameter for proper tracking

### Modified
- Fixed authentication error in hack_agent by adding dotenv import and load_dotenv() call to config.py to properly load ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from .env file
- Enhanced security analysis to find specific vulnerabilities instead of generic categories by updating analysis prompt and response processing in security_analysis_tools.py
- Added severity, evidence fields to vulnerability reporting for more detailed analysis
- Fixed JSON parsing errors in security analysis by adding better error handling and stricter JSON format requirements
